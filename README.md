# User Guide

### Advanced Settings

<!--Double Check Servers Method-->
<details>
  <summary><b>Set the Action on a failed Ping event (Double Check Server)</b></summary>
  <span>
  Select what the program does if there is a failed ping.
  <ul>
    <li><b>None</b>: No double check just write the failed ping to the .txt file.</li>
    <li><b>Same</b>: Double check the same server again and on second fail write to the .txt file.</li>
    <li><b>Google</b>: Double check Google server (8.8.8.8) and note a failed ping if original server didn't respond but Google did. Can only be set if custom servers are used.</li>
    <li><b>Next</b>: Double check the next server and on second fail write the failed ping to the .txt file.</li>
  <ul>
  </span>
</details>

<!--Alternative Ping Method-->
<details>
  <summary><b>Use alternative Ping Method</b></summary>
  <span>
  Set this value to true if you only get the message that the server didn't respond although there is an active internet connection. This error might occur if the ping protocol is blocked by the router or host.
  Request will be send to google.com/generate_204.
  </span>
</details>

<!--Show all Ping Results-->
<details>
  <summary><b>Show all Ping Results</b></summary>
  <span>
  If this value is set to true both successful and unsuccessful pings will be noted. If set to false (default) only unsuccessful pings are recorded.
  </span>
</details>

<!--Use Custom Servers-->
<details>
  <summary><b>Use Custom Servers</b></summary>
  <span>
   Activate this setting if you want to check specific servers. Servers can only be edited if the option is enabled. Only add IP addresses to this list and not domain names (like www.example.com) so the router or DNS server doesn't return a false value. Server can be deleted by highlighting them (with a click) and clicking "Delete". The list can be saved and closed with "Save". "Cancel" will not save the settings. If the program is collecting Data and the servers are changed the collecting process will automatically restart.
   </span>
</details>

### Task Scheduler

<!--Stop application after X days-->
<details>
  <summary><b>Stop the Application after X days</b></summary>
  <span>
  This setting stops the task if the pc is running longer than the value in days. This only applies if the option "Start with Windows" is selected and the application was started by windows itself. If the program is started by the user this setting will not be applied.
  </span>
</details>

<!--Disallow start if on batteries-->
<details>
  <summary><b>Disallow Start if on Batteries</b></summary>
  <span>If this setting is set to true the app will not be launched by the Task Scheduler if the pc is not connected to a power source and is instead running on batteries. Only applies to laptops.
  </span>
</details>

<!--Stop If Going On Batteries-->
<details>
  <summary><b>Stop if going on Batteries</b></summary>
  <span>
  If this setting is set to true the app will stop if the power source is disconnected (running on battery) and the program was started with Windows.
  </span>
</details>

### Update

<!--Download Updates-->
<details>
  <summary><b>Download and Install Updates</b></summary>
  <span>
  New Updates can be installed from the application. If there is a new Update you can click the link to install it.
  </span>

# FAQ

<details>
  <summary><b>Why does the program tell me that I don't have internet although my internet is working fine? </b></summary>
  <span>Some routers may block the ping protocol. For users experiencing this problem please follow the instructions in "use alternative ping method" under advanced settings in this readme.
  </span>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Why does the program sometimes show that the connection is disrupted?</b></summary>
  <span>A failed ping is noted when two servers (depending on the method set in AdvancedSettings.xml) don't respond within 2.5 seconds. Often this is the result of a packet loss within the users network. A very few servers may also not respond within the given time frame of 2.5 seconds or temporary block the users ip address (ping to death prevention). The severs that come with this program should respond within the time frame and won't block the user. The ping protocol doesn't use TCP which would resend data and instead is using ICMP.
  </span>
</details>
<details>
  <summary><b>How do I use this program to check my servers</b></summary>
  <span>In the settings check the Checkbox "Use Custom Servers". Click the button "Edit Servers". Write the IP address into the textbox and click "Add". Highlight servers to delete them. When using custom servers you can check against google servers. Meaning that a failed ping is only noted if your server (defined in Custom Servers) failed a ping but Google didn't. This can be used to rule out the case that just the computer (on which this program is running) lost connection.
  Make sure to click "Save" in both the "Edit Server" and Settings form to apply the new settings.

# Legal Note

Although this program uses less than 100 Bytes (0.000100 Megabytes) to ping a server in an interval (of min. 5 seconds) it may be seen as a (D)DOS or ping of death attack.
We therefore advise the user to put in an interval that is bigger or equal to 30 seconds.
The servers we are pinging (Googles DNS and Cloudflare) should handle the request with ease.
For any programmers we advice against increasing the buffer size in the ping method and to only ping servers that are used to higher traffic.
